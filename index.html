        <p>Basic Setupn and mBlock app is Required:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get an Arduino, an LCD, and an Arduino Joystick.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female black wire into the LCD's GND pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's breadboard's negative pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female red wire into the LCD's VCC pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's breadboard's positive pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female (color of your choice) wire into the LCD's SDA pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's other SDA pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female (color of your choice) wire into the LCD's SCL pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's other SCL pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female black wire into the Joystick's GND pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's breadboard's negative pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female red wire into the Joystick's +5V pin. Then, connect that into your Arduino's breadboard's positive pin.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female (color of your choice) wire into your Joystick's VRX pin. Then, connect it into Analog Pin #1.</li>
            <li>Plug a male-female (color of your choice) wire into your Joystick's VRY pin. Then, connect it into Analog Pin #0.</li>
            <li>Upload the game code.</li>
            <li>Adjust the screw on the back of your LCD using a screwdriver until the text on it is very clear.</li>
            <li>Play the game!</li>
        </ol>
